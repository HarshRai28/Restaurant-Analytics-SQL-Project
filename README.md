# Restaurant Menu Performance Analysis

A small restaurant is seeking to better understand its menu performance since they debuted a new menu at the start of the year. We will dig into the customer data to see which menu items are doing well / not well and what the top customers seem to like best.

## Objective 1: Explore the items table

Get a better understanding of the items table by finding:

- The number of items on the menu, and the least and most expensive items
- How many Italian dishes are on the menu and what is the price range?
- How many dishes are in each category? What is the average dish price within each category?

## Objective 2: Explore the orders table

Get a better understanding of the orders table by finding:

- The date range
- Number of items within each order
- Which orders had the most number of items?
- How many orders had more than 12 items?

## Objective 3: Analyze customer behavior

Combine order_details and menu_items tables together to answer:

- What were the least and most ordered items? What categories were they in?
- Where were the top 5 orders that spent the most money?
- Which specific items were purchased from the highest spending orders?
